# EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers in the cloud. EC2 instances provide scalable compute capacity and are commonly used for a variety of applications, including web hosting, application development, testing, and more.

Here's a high-level summary of EC2 and the different types of EC2 instances:

## EC2 Instance Types

There are many different types of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The best instance type for a particular workload will depend on the specific needs of that workload.

Here are some of the most common EC2 instance types:

**General purpose:** These instances are designed for a wide variety of workloads, including web servers, application servers, and databases. They are a good choice for workloads that do not have specific requirements for CPU, memory, or storage.


**Compute optimized:** These instances are designed for workloads that require high CPU performance. They are a good choice for workloads such as high-performance computing (HPC), scientific computing, and machine learning.


**Memory optimized:** These instances are designed for workloads that require a large amount of memory. They are a good choice for workloads such as in-memory databases, caching, and analytics.


**Storage optimized:** These instances are designed for workloads that require a large amount of storage. They are a good choice for workloads such as data warehouses, big data, and archival storage.


**Accelerated computing:** These instances are designed for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs or FPGAs. They are a good choice for workloads such as graphics rendering, video encoding, and machine learning.


When choosing an EC2 instance type, it is important to consider the following factors:

* **Workload:** What type of workload will the instance be running?
* **CPU:** How much CPU performance does the workload need?
* **Memory:** How much memory does the workload need?
* **Storage:** How much storage does the workload need?
* **Network:** How much bandwidth does the workload need?
* **Cost:** How much can you afford to spend on an instance?

Once you have considered these factors, you can use the AWS Instance Type Comparison Tool to narrow down your choices. This tool allows you to compare different instance types based on a variety of factors, such as CPU, memory, storage, network, and cost.

It is also important to note that there are several different ways to pay for EC2 instances. You can pay on-demand, which means you pay for the instance by the hour. You can also purchase reserved instances, which gives you a discount on the hourly rate in exchange for committing to a one-year or three-year term. Additionally, you can use Spot Instances, which are unused instances that Amazon sells at a significantly reduced price. However, Spot Instances can be terminated at any time by Amazon if they are needed for other purposes.

By carefully considering your workload requirements and budget, you can choose the right EC2 instance type for your needs.
